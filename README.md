# Weather-Radar

I built a weather forecast application that utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Fetching API from the open weather, my application will show the users the current temperature at their current location. They can convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git
